# 1. Getting Started

## 1.1 Install and launching R packages

The code chunk below uses **p_load()** of pacman package to check if `tmap`, `sf`, `tidyverse` packages are installed into the R environment. If they are, then they will be launched into R.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tmap, sf, tidyverse)
```

## 1.2 Importing the OD data

Firstly, we will import the [Passenger Volume by Origin Destination Bus Stops]{.underline} data set downloaded from LTA DataMall by

```{r}
odbus <- read_csv("data/origin_destination_bus_202308.csv")
```
